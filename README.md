this is the code from my extended project qualification which I completed in year 12.

the program is designed to encrypt and decrypt integers using RSA encryption.

to generate new encryption keys, input a number with no encryption keys and it will generate a new pair for you.
when generating new keys, keep input numbers below 100 since the program is not efficient and will take a long time to finish.
